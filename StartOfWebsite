Instructions: <br>
Crates <br>
Whenever you encounter a crate, <br>
You can shoot it to open it. Crates <br>
can contain a lot of really good <br>
upgrades including a tier 5 upgrade. <br>
<br>
The Map <br>
The Map is the tool at the bottom <br>
right of your screen. it allows you <br>
to see where the next border will be, <br>
pinpoint the location of a super crate <br>
drop, and tell you where the toxic fog <br>
is at that moment. <br>
<br>
Upgrades <br>
there are 4 different upgrade categories <br>
in the game. these can be your speed, <br>
your bullet speed, your fire rate, and <br>
your build strength. <br>
<br>
Special Upgrades <br>
There are 3 different special upgrades <br>
these are the amount of bullets you <br>
fire, which can go from one to three, <br>
a drone which fires a bullet for you, <br>
and a shield which lets you survive <br>
one additional hit. <br>
<h2> Leveling and Cosmetics </h2>
<p> Every time you pop another copter, <br>
get to another place on the <br>
leaderboard, or fly for a certain <br>
amount of time, you get XP. this <br>
can be used to level up your <br>
copter, which can means that you <br>
unlock new cosmetics in the <br>
"customize" option in the shop <br> </p>
